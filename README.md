# Quiz-Show

For this project I am looking to create an online-quiz that is Code-Related. My objective is to begin with a 60 second timer. One a click the quiz starts and the timer begins. The correct answers will log and best score will display as a high score. On a wrong answer, the question will cycle and 10 seconds would be removed from the time. 

The mock up for the design is https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/945/files/889512/preview.
